# NPSE checkpoint — 2026-10-24

Branch: `feature/npse-shared-services`; review PR #14.
Last published implementation commit: `353f7671ff0ccee490ae39c4c64d446312486f93`.
The commit containing this checkpoint is the documentation/source continuation;
use `git log -1` and current Actions for its final exact SHA/results.
Base: `feature/usb-doctor-intelligence` at 9a4392a37b85186032ded8cdbe254b2064d8ed9b.

Implemented: reusable Java core + Android AAR; optional shell-only provider;
fixed caller-checked UserService; bounded/cancelable execution shared by the
original MR metadata helper; Standard Android diagnostics/visible-app settings;
AR/EN RTL non-exported control center and wizard; explicit local JSON export.
No desktop engine, new companion or new repository was duplicated.

Read `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md`, `SHIZUKU_INTEGRATION.md`,
`SECURITY_MODEL.md`, `TEST_RESULTS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and
`docs/npse/REPOSITORY_AUDIT.md` before continuing. Current core test passed 47 assertions. Android CI build/unit/lint passed at 353f767.
Initial API 34/35 emulator failures were a JSON display-string assertion; the test
now parses the schema. Seven historical Gitleaks matches were public header
hashes; exact historical exceptions and local 0-findings reruns are documented.
Final emulator/current-source CI still needs recorded results.
No OPPO/ColorOS hardware is connected, so device/Shizuku/reboot acceptance is pending.

Next: run the current source checks, inspect exact CI errors, preserve actual
emulator screenshots/APK if available, classify redacted history findings,
review Maven local publication, then plan Guardian adoption. Do not claim 60/60,
production readiness or physical device success. Main was not merged.

# Current repair/USB priority — 2026-10-24

New forensic features are paused by the current user directive. Preserve existing
forensic code and critical regression/security coverage. Resume the active
`feature/usb-doctor-intelligence` slice from PR #9 head
`2b0a83a28c1ca6b11db85c6753da935a150e9fd0` (all seven native CI jobs green in
40017343409; Python/public-history also green; Windows portable/installer exist).

USB Doctor adds a pure interpretation engine, timestamped discovery outcomes,
strict PnP inventory validation, target-scoped problem-code explanations and a
real AR/EN panel. Windows inventory no longer requires a detected phone. No
physical-cause, interface binding or commercial model acceptance is inferred.
See docs/device-services/USB_DOCTOR.md and ELITE_LAB_SCOPE.md.

Local connection tests 42 passed; UI 38 per profile without QML warnings.
Both profiles completed all 32 CTest suites after relinking one empty local
executable per profile (initial failures and reruns preserved in evidence).
Hosted exact-commit Windows/Linux CI is the next gate before promotion. Next: device field provenance, firmware risk analysis, OEM adapter
contracts, then an isolated training simulator. Do not resume the older forensic
feature backlog below while the strategic freeze remains active.

# Current UI rebuild checkpoint — 2026-10-23

Resume `feature/professional-workstation-ui`. The new 12-section Qt/QML shell,
responsive dashboard/device operations, shared cards/tokens and 24 licensed color
SVG assets are implemented. Current acceptance/evidence: `docs/ui/REBUILD_ACCEPTANCE.md`.
Native services/policy remain authoritative; no main merge or Stage 60 claim.

Local production CTest 31/31; final UI regression 37 passed with zero QML warnings.
Laboratory CTest also passed 31/31, UI 37 with zero QML warnings.
Review PR #9 is published; exact-source Windows CI is in progress.
A focused follow-up distinguishes authorized/unauthorized/offline/Fastboot target
states in the header and covers all four asynchronous engines.
GitHub connector access is now working for the NEXVARY account; the earlier
connection-failure statements below describe the preceding checkpoint only.
Remote Desktop Commander still reports no connected device. Use Windows CI,
then clean-host/physical acceptance separately. No work runs outside an active session.

# NEXVARY-MR continuation checkpoint

Date: 2026-10-23. Base remote commit: `7c928b0d5cc3842964dcbe9f207971c09af588b5`.
Local branch: `feature/requirements-gap-exif`. The commit containing this file
is the tested source checkpoint. Main remains unchanged. Stage 60 is not passed.

Read `docs/REQUIREMENTS_GAP_MATRIX.md` and
`docs/release/EXIF_INCREMENT_2026-10-23.md` before making changes. The source of
truth is the actual commit and raw evidence, not old conversation reports.

## Completed this increment

44-item gap matrix and branch/PR/Actions audit; proven annotation for historical
CI failure; bounded JPEG Exif allowlist; case integration and consented AR/EN UI;
tests, mutation target, independent Pillow fixture, documentation corrections.
Local Release warnings-as-errors CTest: production 29/29, Laboratory 29/29.
Exif 18 and QML 34 cases per profile; Python 27 plus portal 6; ASan/UBSan mutation
12000 passed without local leak inspection. Intentional/external skips and initial
failed runs are preserved under `evidence/exif-2026-10-23/`.

## Do not repeat or misreport

- scrcpy, barcode/device cards, AVB, classic PCAP, DPAPI update-key storage and
  authenticated journal predate this increment. Inspect existing code first.
- Baseline CI 40000060143 and its Windows artifacts passed at 7c928b0. They do
  not contain this increment; Windows CI for this local commit is still pending.
- Historical run 39896846776 was stopped by GitHub's billing/spending diagnostic
  before job execution. Do not invent a YAML/build failure for it.
- No new remote PR/commit/release exists from this session. Git push lacks
  credentials, the GitHub app connection is unusable, and no remote desktop is
  connected. Recheck actual authorization surfaces when they become available.

## Resume execution

1. Restore/fetch this local branch from the supplied Git bundle or apply its
   binary patch to the exact base. Preserve any unrelated work; never reset main.
2. Compare with any newer remote integration HEAD. Publish a development branch
   through the working authorized GitHub connection; create/update a review PR
   without merging main. Run exact-head Windows/Linux CI and fix actual failures.
3. Work on gap 19: choose one unencrypted owner-authorized backup format, provide
   known populated artifacts, reject malformed/oversized input, preserve hashes,
   and expose results through the existing case engine. Do not claim generic
   Android/iOS extraction or cryptographic bypass.
4. Then gap 20 ALEAPP external adapter and gap 23 PCAPNG, with pinned provenance,
   bounded copies/processes/output and independent fixtures. Keep device/clean-VM
   gates separate; do not postpone independent code because hardware is absent.

Build both profiles using repository `scripts/prepare_sodium.py`, then the
commands in `docs/release/DEVELOPMENT_CHECKPOINT_2026-10-23.md`. No background work
or continuation outside an active session is scheduled or claimed.
